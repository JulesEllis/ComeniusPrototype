# Coaching app for statistical writing.
This project contains an application that helps students writing statistical reports, both English and Dutch.
The app generates assignments, let the student report about it, and provides indiviual feedback when requested.
The app also has several other buttons that may help the student while writing.

The 'basic report' (Dutch: elementair rapport) assignments provide raw data and ask for a structured, pointwise report.
The 'short report' (Dutch: beknopt rapport) assignments provide SPSS-like output, and ask for a report in natural language,
as one would write in the Results section of an APA-style article.

This app is a prototype that was created in the Comenius Senior Fellow 2020 project titled "Coaching App for Statistical Writing"
on the Faculty of Social Sciences of the Radboud University Nijmegen in 2020-2023.

The app was developed by Jelmer Jansen, under supervision of Jules Ellis. Design advises were given by Marleen Hofman,
Kimberly Wanders, Loreen Simons, Jule Klapdor, Minke Coort, Sara Pieters.
